# PyBot
A Telegram Bot which interprets messages as python code


## setup
after downloading the project, you'll need to create a Telegram-Bot. in this process you will get a api-key for your newly created bot. save this key.

go to the downloaded PyBot project files and add a new python file to the PyBot directory. name it 'Constants.py'. open the file and add the line

```py
API_KEY = 'xxxxx'
```

replace 'xxxxx' by the saved api key for your Telegram-Bot. now you are ready to go.

execute main.py. now you should be able to run python code on your Telegram-Bot. have fun :)
